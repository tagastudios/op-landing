# OP Academy — Marketing Landing Page

A promotional marketing landing page for an education / academy product. **Development paused.** Kept as a personal archive and reference — one of my earliest frontend projects.

## About

This was built as a static promotional landing page featuring course cards, email signup, a gamified quiz (QQSM-style), and an onboarding flow. It showcases where I started as a frontend developer and serves as a milestone in my learning journey.
